====================================

Simple Profile Search and Profile Creation using Angular JS.
AngularJS is a JavaScript framework with MVC capability, maintained by Google, that assists with running single-page applications. The library reads in HTML that contains additional custom tag attributes; it then obeys the directives in those custom attributes, and binds input or output parts of the page to a model represented by standard JavaScript variables. The values of those JavaScript variables can be manually set, or retrieved from static or dynamic JSON resources.

Simple POC for Angular JS. Used WEbAPI and EntityFramework to get and save the profiles in database.
